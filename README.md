# PHAS0077 - Code

This repository contains code for the PHAS0077: Scientific Computing Individual Research Project which was titled **Time-Evolution of Molecules**. It consists of two main Python modules: `diatomic.py` and `multiatomic.py`; the latter is a generalization of the former for the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of real systems with interpolated potential energy surfaces and numerical forces. It also contains MD simulation programs in Jupyter Notebooks which are named appropriately. When these notebooks are run, corresponding temporary folders which contain simulation data and figures are generated. The repository also includes required data files.

## Getting Started

1. Just run the Jupyter Notebooks!
2. Modify accordingly and run again!
